        <dl><em><strong><h2>Directions</h2></strong></em></dl>
        <dt>
            <dd><Strong>Step 1</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Make curry sauce: Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook onions in hot oil until soft and starting to caramelize, about 8 minutes. Add potatoes and carrots. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until potatoes are soft, about 45 minutes.</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 2</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Remove from heat and stir in curry sauce mix until dissolved. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, jam, and soy sauce. Simmer until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 3</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Meanwhile, make chicken katsu: Flatten chicken breasts with a kitchen mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Season with salt and pepper.</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 4</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Place flour onto a large plate, add beaten egg to a small plate, and place bread crumbs onto a second large plate.</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 5</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Press chicken into flour to coat, dip in beaten egg, and press in bread crumbs to coat generously.</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 6</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Heat oil in a large saucepan to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Carefully lower breaded cutlets into hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into a cutlet should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 7</Strong></dd>
            <dl>While chicken is cooking, stir curry powder into sauce until incorporated.</dl>
            <dd><Strong>Step 8</Strong></dd>
            <dl>Slice chicken into strips and spoon curry sauce over the top to serve.</dl>
